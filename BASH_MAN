-------------3.1.1 Shell Operation-------------

- Reads its input
- Breaks the input into words and operators
	> obeying the quoting rules described in Quoting
	> tokens are separated by metacharacters
	> select which meanings to assign various words and characters
- Parses the tokens into simple and compound commands (see Shell Commands).
- Performs the various shell expansions (see Shell Expansions)
	> breaking the expanded tokens into lists of filenames (see Filename Expansion) and commands and arguments
- Performs any necessary redirections (see Redirections)
	> and removes the redirection operators and their operands from the argument list
- Executes the command (see Executing Commands).
- Optionally waits for the command to complete
	> and collects its exit status (see Exit Status)
