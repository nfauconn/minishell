The "keyboard" doesnt send any signals, the line discipline does. Find out what a line discipline is, then read man 1 stty

REDIR
	- handle max opened fd ?
	- HEREDOC what path ??? should return a char * so we can set for the cmd (e.g. if there are mutliple heredocs)

BUILTINS
	export without arg ==> sorted env

SIGNALS
	- ctrl + \ in child : quit (core dumped) POURQUOI CA AFFICHE PAS
		ET need to update last status --> global variable ?

	- free sh->env when user exit minishell

CHILD
	- free memory if failed
	- close everything

PARSING
	PIPE THEN NOTHING
		$ echo lol |
		>
	REDIR_STUCK_TO_PIPE >|
		is a redirecting operator used to overwrite file even if option noclobber is set

for file in `find -name "linux_*.mp4"`; do mv "$file" "${file/linux_/}" ; done

minish> echo $USER$USER$"$USERcoucou'$USER"  '$USER'     $USER     "-$lol- hehe..."


VALGRIND
	valgrind --suppressions=ignoreleak --leak-check=full --show-leak-kinds=all --track-fds=yes --track-origins=yes --verbose ./minishell

SIMPLE COMMAND RETURN
	The return status (see Exit Status) of a simple command is its exit status, or 128+n if the command was terminated by signal n. 

EXPAND
	In the context where an assignment statement is assigning a value to a shell variable or array index (see Arrays), the ‘+=’ operator can be used to append to or add to the variable’s previous value. 
	This includes arguments to builtin commands such as declare that accept assignment statements (declaration commands). 
	When ‘+=’ is applied to a variable for which the integer attribute has been set, value is evaluated as an arithmetic expression and added to the variable’s current value, which is also evaluated. 
	When ‘+=’ is applied to an array variable using compound assignment (see Arrays), the variable’s value is not unset (as it is when using ‘=’), and new values are appended to the array beginning at one greater than the array’s maximum index (for indexed arrays), or added as additional key-value pairs in an associative array. 
	When applied to a string-valued variable, value is expanded and appended to the variable’s value.

HEREDOC
	!!!!!!!! if delimiter has quotes -> delimiter is set without it
									 -> strings will be expanded considering the quoting rule
